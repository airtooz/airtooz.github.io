# Hello Github Blog

This is my first blog, also some of the reminders for markdown files

> Type ` using the key left to number 1

```python
print("Hello Github Blog")
```

The best and most convienient way to edit the blog is still straight through Github editor.  
From a local manner, it seems unable to preview the results instead of commiting and pushing first.
